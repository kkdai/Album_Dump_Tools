Album_Dump_Tools
================

A lot of album dump tools which write by myself to dump photo and Exif related data from others albums.

## PHP

### 4Image_Dump.php

It is a simple dump php to dump all photo, name, description from [4image](http://www.4homepages.de/). See more detail on [this](https://github.com/kkdai/Album_Dump_Tools). <br>



## CSharp

### Exifbatch

It is a batch helper for [exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) in Windows. Because it seems Golang process command line parameter has some problem with it. So I design to switch language on it.

More detail check [it's document](CSharp\exifbatch\README.md).
