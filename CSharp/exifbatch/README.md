###  Exifbatch

It is a batch helper for [exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) in Windows. Because it seems Golang process command line parameter has some problem with it. So I design to switch language on it.


### How it work

This application only work in following environment:
- Windows 7 or above
- Install VS2013 Runtime
- Need download Exiftool first

Put [Exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) Windows version execution file in "D:\"

Run this applition.
